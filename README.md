Trying out some git commands

Tried commands:

1. ls -la : to show all the hidden files & folder

2. git status : shows all the files which were created, updated & deleted but haven't been saved in a commit yet.

3. git add . : save all the untracked changes for the next commit

4. git commit -m <msg> -m <description> : new version of repo would be created but would not be live on github

5. git push : push commit from local machine to github

6. git init : initialize git repo

7. git remote add origin <ssh_key> : To host the code to an empty github repo

8. git branch : to check the branch name

9. git checkout -b <feature-branch> : to switch to a new feature branch (omit -b to switch to an existing branch)
